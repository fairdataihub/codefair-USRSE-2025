# Repository of the Codefair presentation material for the US-RSE 2025 conference (October 6-8, 2025 in Philadelphia, PA, USA)

## About

This repository contains the material and information associated with our talk at the 3rd Annual Conference of the US Research Software Engineer Associate (US-RSE 2025). We are presenting Codefair, an open source and free GitHub app for making biomedical research software FAIR.

**Abstract**: 

Making software Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) can be time-consuming and difficult, especially since it is a continuous process throughout a software’s lifecycle. Codefair is designed to automate the process, letting researchers concentrate on the goals of their software. It is developed as a free and open-source (MIT license) platform with two components: a GitHub app and a web app. Once the Codefair GitHub app is installed on a software’s GitHub repository, Codefair seamlessly integrates into the typically software development workflow by monitoring the repository using tools like Probot, providing feedback via a GitHub issue, allowing the user to address them through user-friendly interfaces on the Codefair web app, and even submitting pull requests automatically to maintain continuous FAIR compliance. With thorough documentation and a design focused on ease-of-use, Codefair is accessible to all. When introduced at US-RSE’24 in an early development phase, Codefair primarily assisted researchers in adding essential metadata elements such as license, CITATION.cff, and codemeta.json. Since then, it has expanded to support streamlined archival on Zenodo and automated validation of Common Workflow Language (CWL) files. A new web dashboard enables easy assessment and management of FAIR compliance across your GitHub repositories. Usage of Codefair has also increased as it is now installed on over 400 GitHub repositories. By alleviating the time and effort needed for FAIR compliance, Codefair encourages biomedical researchers to embrace FAIR and open practices. In this presentation, we will detail our development approach, outline current features, discuss planned features, summarize updates since US-RSE’24, and invite the community to explore and contribute to Codefair.
